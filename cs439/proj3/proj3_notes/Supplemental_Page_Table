What this should do:
Decides where to load the executable (which frame to map to?) and which page of the executing process to load.
Decides how to get the swap disk and where in the swap disk each swapped page is.

We should probably use a hash table for this.

We should change the load_segment function in process.c to fill up the supplementary page table without loading pages into memory.
Then have the page fault handler consult the supplementary page able and then load pages.
