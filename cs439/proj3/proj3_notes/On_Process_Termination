Destroy your supplementary page table (the table entry? Does each process have its own SPT?)
Free your frames (and their frame table entries)
Do the same with swap slots, if any.
Close all your files: If a file is mmapped (?) and dirty, write the dirty mmapped pages from memory back to the file disk.

Possibly: If written to, write it through to disc.
