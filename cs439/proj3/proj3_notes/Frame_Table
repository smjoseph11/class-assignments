E-how to 'make a frame table'

We need it to keep track of the VAS pages mapped to physical memory

Each frame should know a few things.
1. The thread it belongs to (or NULL).
2. Page table entry mapped to it (or NULL).
3. Status booleans for:
I. If it's mapped or not.
II. If it's pinned or not.*1
III+. ???
IV. Profit!

Implement our own frame allocator.
Look at init.c and palloc.c and understand them. They are useful.
We don't have to use a hash table. (Maybe we can anyway?)

Why do we care about this bullshit?
Allocate physical memory and figure out who to swap when full.
