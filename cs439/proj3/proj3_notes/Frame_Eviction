Figure out who to swap out when you're full but more memory needs to be accessed.

Pick an algorithm, such as second chance or additional reference bit, or something else from section 9.4 of the textbook. (clock?)

Select a frame to swap out
-Get the matching page table entry
-Use a pagedir function to get the hardware dirty bit and use that.

Send the swapped out frame to the swap disc.
-Synchronize so that you can't change the frame during swapping.

Update the supplementary page table and the hardware page table (using pagedir functions) as needed.
